## What is this?
System Readiness for Workstations is an automated privacy-focused configuration tool which debloats and tweaks Windows 11 Pro N for Workstations to improve it's performance and reduce the user's footprint.

## Getting started
Get started by opening PowerShell as administrator, then copy and right-click on the PowerShell window, this command:
> `iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JcZRV')`

Or, if you prefer, allow the execution of untrusted scripts on PowerShell by using `Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted`. Afterwards, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gfelipe099/sunvalley-srw/master/sunvalley-srw.ps1) to download the script and execute it yourself using `.\sunvalley-srw.ps1`.
